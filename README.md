# 2034 Version of Yourself Portfolio
 
The brief is to design and build a responsive website that represents the professional portfolio of a version of you in 2034. This can be as realistic or as fantastical as you like, provided you are explicit about the effects of your decision on the design and execution of your assignment.

The web site should have 5 pages with different types of material and media, including video and sound clips if relevant.


## About this website
**Time Travel:** Given my passion for history, I sought to transform a traditional career into something more creative and unconventional. By becoming a time travel tour guide, I’ve found a unique way to combine my love for storytelling, education, and adventure into an experience that goes beyond the ordinary. 
**Aim:** I hope to enrich the tourism and education industry by offering immersive experiences that bridge the gap between learning and adventure.
